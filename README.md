# kryo-more

Kryo 5.x serializers for the various `com.github.tommyettinger` libraries.

This lets Kryo 5.x (currently 5.3.0) de/serialize objects from [RegExodus](https://github.com/tommyettinger/RegExodus),
[digital](https://github.com/tommyettinger/digital), [jdkgdxds](https://github.com/tommyettinger/jdkgdxds),
and [juniper](https://github.com/tommyettinger/juniper).

## How to get

Each sub-library has its own version, linked to the version of the library it de/serializes.

  - kryo-regexodus is currently version 0.1.13.0
  - kryo-digital is currently version 0.1.1.0
  - kryo-jdkgdxds is currently version 1.0.4.0
  - kryo-juniper is currently version 0.1.3.0

When I have the Gradle/Maven coordinates figured out, I'll update this with them.
